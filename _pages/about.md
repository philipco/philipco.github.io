I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics under the joint supervision of [Eric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr), professor at the [CMAP laboratory](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/), Ecole Polytechnique, and [Aymeric Dieuleveut](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ge-OinUAAAAJ&hl=fr), associate professor at the CMAP laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique. 

I am working on [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning), analyzing the trade-offs between data privacy, communication cost and data heterogeneity in the context of distributed learning. 
Here is [a short presentation](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/federated-learning-privacy-friendly-ai) of Federated Learning where I try to give the key concepts.

I am graduated from [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/), Grenoble with a focus on Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and 3D Animation. 
I also had the opportunity to do a six-months academic exchange with the [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/), Moscow to study Statistics, Machine Learning and Image recognition under the supervision of [Vadim Strijov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=3TpENmIAAAAJ&hl=en).

As part of my Ph.D., I help with the organization of the [CJC-MA 2021](https://cjc-ma2021.github.io/) (Congress of young research in Applied Mathematics) as President of the Organizing Committee. 
This congress will take place at Ecole Polytechnique in October 2021 and aim to gather young researchers from the whole of France.
