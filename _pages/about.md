I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics under the joint supervision of [Eric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=fr), professor at the [CMAP laboratory](www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/), Ecole Polytechnique, and [Aymeric Dieuleveut](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ge-OinUAAAAJ&hl=fr), associate professor at the [CMAP laboratory](www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/), Ecole Polytechnique. 

I am working on [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning), analyzing the trade-offs between data privacy, communication cost and data heterogeneity in the context of distributed learning. Here is [a short presentation](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/federated-learning-privacy-friendly-ai) of Federated Learning where I try to give the key concepts without going in the details. 

I am graduated from [Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/), Grenoble with a focus on Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and 3D Animation. I also had the opportunity to do an six-months academic exchange with the [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/), Moscow to study Statistics, Machine Learning and Image recognition under the supervision of [Vadim Strijov](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=3TpENmIAAAAJ&hl=en).
